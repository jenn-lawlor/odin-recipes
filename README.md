# Odin Recipes

A project from [The Odin Project – Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).  
It’s a simple recipe website built with basic HTML as a refresher exercise.

## Features

- Home page (`index.html`) linking to multiple recipe pages
- Individual recipe pages with images and sections containing lorem ipsum
- Basic site structure using headings, paragraphs, and lists

## Reflection

I already knew basic HTML, so this was mainly a quick refresher.  
It helped reinforce version control habits and set the stage for later projects.
